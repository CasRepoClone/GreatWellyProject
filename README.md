# GreatWellyProject

The School has provided its GCSE and A Level students with the
opportunity to complete a full and meaningful programme of study
during the summer and to emerge with an assessed outcome at the
end of the term.

Students in the Upper Sixth will complete the Wellington Diploma, and will be awarded a
'pass', 'merit' or 'distinction' for their efforts. The Diploma is composed of a substantial piece
of independent research, on a topic of each student's choice, and a number of online short
courses. Dan Millington, Head of Sixth Form at Wellington, has provided students with a wide
range of options when it comes to the online short courses, with topics such as financial
management, aeronautical engineering, writing fiction, European law, modern building
design and neurobiology on offer. Please follow this link to find out more about the
Diploma http://online.fliphtml5.com/ltbxz/yuxn/
GCSE students are expected to complete the Wellington Summer Certificate and, as for the
Diploma, will be awarded either a 'pass', 'merit' or 'distinction' for their work. Sam Dean, Head
of Upper School, has structured the Summer Certificate to include a substantial piece of
independent research and students will also embark on a programme of pre-Sixth Form
courses. The programme provides students with the opportunity to elect four A Level
subjects, which they will then explore more closely within a newly designed Year 11 timetable.

Central to both the Diploma and the Summer Certificate is the 'Great Welly Project', a
carefully designed programme intended to allow students to present an 'exhibit' their choice
and to then share the 'record' of the creation of their exhibit to a wider audience. While
students in the Year 11 and the Upper Sixth are required to complete a Project in order to
earn the Summer Certificate or Diploma, students of all ages, from both the Prep and Senior
School, will be invited to take part in the Great Welly Project. Tutors will provide support and
guidance to their students as they complete their project. Rob Stevens, Head of Enrichment,
has crafted the Great Welly Project in such a way as to provide students with maximum
flexibility so that they are able to follow their individual intellectual interests. Please follow

An exciting element of the Diploma, Summer Certificate and Project is that students will have
the opportunity to listen to Old Wellingtonians and to learn from their professional journeys.
Clare Bailey, Careers Coordinator at Wellington, believes that being able to network with the
School's successful and supportive alumni will also provide students with the chance to
explore mentoring and work experience opportunities.
When launching these opportunities to the school community, Eugene du Toit, Headmaster
said "We know that certain skills are central to learning and are highly valued in the
workplace: being critical in your thinking, creative when solving complex problems, able to
coherently articulate sophisticated ideas clearly and concisely and able to work

independently. Evidence of these skills allow selection panels to separate 'the wheat from the
chaff' when faced with a field of applicants; those young adults able to evidence these skills
will, without doubt, move to the front of whichever queue they are in."
He went on to say "The Diploma, Certificate and Project gives students the opportunity to
demonstrate how engaged, ambitious and committed they are to their learning. At
Wellington, we believe that learning should be both enjoyable and challenging; we have every
confidence in our students' ability to meet the challenge we have set them."
